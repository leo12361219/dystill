CHANGELOG

v0.1
- Initial release

v0.1.1
- Changed the way filter actions worked. Previously all comparisons were done by
  regular expression. Now changes can be one of 5 ways (starts with, ends with,
  contains, equals, and regular expression). Added a field to the database to 
  store this.
  
v0.1.2
- BUGFIX: Now actually support subfolders in IMAP. Previous version contained a
  bug that would cause a maildir to be created that wasn't accessable.
  
- FEATURE: Support added for delimiters in email addressed in situations whre 
  the MTA doesn't handle parsing it for us (Postfix).
