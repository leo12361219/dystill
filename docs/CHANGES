CHANGELOG

v0.1
- Initial release

v0.1.1
- Changed the way filter actions worked. Previously all comparisons were done by
  regular expression. Now changes can be one of 5 ways (starts with, ends with,
  contains, equals, and regular expression). Added a field to the database to 
  store this.
  
v0.1.2
- BUGFIX: Now actually support subfolders in IMAP. Previous version contained a
  bug that would cause a maildir to be created that wasn't accessable.
  
- FEATURE: Support added for delimiters in email addressed in situations whre 
  the MTA doesn't handle parsing it for us (Postfix).
  
v0.2
- Purposely broke the association between Postfix's DB style and Dystill, 
  hopefully allowing for wider adoption. 

  - This means dropping the user_id association in Dystill's DB schema and 
    replacing it with a text field containing the user email address. "Wildcard"
    rules are still supported using an empty string ('') in the email field.
    
  - New configuration parameter, maildir_path, specifies the location and path 
    of the maildir. {to_address} is replaced with the email address of the 
    recipient (the maildir location)
    
- BUGFIX: An issue where folder names with certain characters would cause 
  issues with mail delivery.
