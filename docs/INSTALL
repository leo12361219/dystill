INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

dystill requires the Python argparse and MySQLdb libraries, so be sure you have 
them before begininng

Download and install dystill. You can put the script anywhere you like - I went 
ahead and put it in /usr/bin. You will need to adjust the accompanying config as
required and put it in /etc or specify it's location on the command line.

I've only used and tested dystill with Postfix, but it's pretty simple and 
should theoretically be able to work with just about any MTA that supports 
piping. Still, the instructions here are presented for Postfix.

First, add the included SQL schema to your email database. This works especially
well if you have followed similar instructions* to the ones I did when setting 
up my email server.

Next, be sure you have customized your /etc/dystill.conf file, and that all the 
database settings are correct. 

Next, edit your master.cf file and add the following:

dystill  unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  flags=DRhu user=vmail argv=/usr/bin/dystill.py -d ${recipient}
  
Next, edit your main.cf file as follows:

mailbox_command = dystill
virtual_transport = dystill

That's it! Send a test message and see if it works.
